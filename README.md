This is a simple implementation of numerical methods using Python.

## How to use:
1. Run the command prompt or any terminal.
2. Use python and run `.py` files
3. Solve!

### Note:
- This is not user-friendly and will never be user-friendly as this is only a practice to improve my Python programming skills. Thank you.
